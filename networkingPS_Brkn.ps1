Networking Assignment (PowerShell) : Scripting the Deployment Pipeline 

.DESCRIPTION

  This script will run several network tests commands and display an exception if the server is not configured to receive Inbound calls or added as a TrustedHost. 
      The following needs to be configured on each server
         1. Run Enable-PSRemoting
       2. Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In) needs to be enables. use New-NetFirewallRule to set the firewall rules.
         3. Configure WinRM and allow your client PC as a TrustedHost
         4. Run Test-WsMan ComputerName to test if WinRM is correctly setup

  NOTE: Please update the IPAddresses.txt file with your own IP addresses or Computer Names, and also ensure that you have the Settings.ini file.

.CONCLUSION
   The goal of the script was to execute a list of commands from a central Windows server connecting 
   to multiple remote servers on the same network. The list of commands is testing networks connections, 
   get the current user logged onto the server, check if any security warnings and errors on the server’s 
   event logs, display the server’s detailed network information and check if any given ports are open or 
   closed on the server. 

   The strategy selected was to connect to multiple Windows operating machines only connected on the same 
   domain sharing the same gateway. It is important to note that this script will not work if all windows 
   machines are not on the same trusted network domain. 

   The user requires administrator rights on the domain to be able to connect to all windows servers. 
   It is recommended to run the Enable-PSRemoting command and to enable the Window Remote Manager services 
   on all windows servers to establish connectivity between these servers. The Settings.ini file contains 
   the location of the IPAddresses.txt file which has a list of either computer names or IP addresses. 
   It also includes the path where the script will write logs and messages to an output.log file. The settings 
   file also contains a list of ports to validate for all servers. This script ran successfully on a newly 
   created domain environment configured using VMWare, using a Windows 2019 server running Active Directory 
   connecting to a Window 10 personal computer. 
   
   The main function, called Network-Tests, accepts the list of servers from the IPAddresses.txt file and calls 
   other functions to execute each task individually. This method ensures each function executes independently 
   and consist of its internal exception handling. The script will continue to run, even If one remote server 
   incorrectly configured or an exception thrown for one or more commands executed.
